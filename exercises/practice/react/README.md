# React

Implement a basic reactive system.

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how values
are computed in terms of each other to allow a change to one value to
automatically propagate to other values, like in a spreadsheet.

Implement a basic reactive system with cells with settable values ("input"
cells) and cells with values computed in terms of other cells ("compute"
cells). Implement updates so that when an input value is changed, values
propagate to reach a new stable system state.

In addition, compute cells should allow for registering change notification
callbacks.  Call a cell’s callbacks when the cell’s value in a new stable
state has changed from the previous stable state.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read [D page](http://exercism.io/languages/d) on
exercism.io.  This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```D
static if (all_tests_enabled)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard D facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [DRefLanguage](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html)
and [DReference](https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html) are references to the D language and D standard library.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
